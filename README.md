# GraphQL Example

I created this repo while trying to test GraphQL for the first time.

## Steps to get this running

Run the `npm install` command when in the directory (Make sure you have `Node` installed).

Run `npm start` to start the server.

Run `npm test` to run the test client, make sure the server is already running for this.

Happy Coding.
